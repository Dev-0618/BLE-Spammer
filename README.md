This project involves using an Arduino UNO Mini paired with an HM-10 module to implement a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) spammer. The setup is designed to send continuous BLE advertisements, simulating multiple Bluetooth devices. This can be useful for testing BLE-based systems, network behavior under heavy loads, or exploring BLE communication.
